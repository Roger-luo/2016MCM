## intervention plan
As shown in our prediction. China will suffer from water scarcity in 15 years. Therefore we designed an intervention plan to avoid this situation. 

To introduce the natural uncertainty from environment, a normal distributed random variable with variance of each factor is added to prominent parameters.
The variance of Ability shows the sensitivity of a given region.

### Population Intervention
The huge population base has become the most serious problem in China and plays a leading role in China's water stress problem. To improve the ability of water supply family planning can play a significant role.  We decrease the population growth rate to 1% and the result is obvious.

### Water Distribution Intervention
One of the most important issue in China's water allocation problem is the uneven distributed water resources. By developing infrastructure,a better water allocation will be possible to achieve.  
increase irrigation area by 30%

### Industrial Intervention
Virtual water has been a hot issue recently,which refers to the hidden flow of water if food or other commodities are traded from place to another. In our model, the water-consuming industry is evaluated by steel production. Therefore water stress can be alleviated by reducing steel production and import more steel. The result of reducing 30% of the steel production is shown in [fig]

decrease by 30%
