# Intervention Plan
- 少于1700立方米为面临供水压力
- 少于1000立方米为缺水
- 当一个地方没有足够的饮用水时，会出现水危机

## causes of water scaricity

### climate

- Many aquifers have been over-pumped and are not recharging quickly. Although the total fresh water supply is not used up, much has become polluted, salted, unsuitable or otherwise unavailable for drinking, industry and agriculture.

- solution: industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently(in the meantime the food productivity have to meet growing demands for food)

### water crisis

manifestations of the water crisis

- inadequate access to safe drinking water for about 884 million people
- inadequate access to sanitaion for 2.5 billion people,which often leads to water polution
- Groundwater overdrafting(excessive use) leading to diminished agricultural yields
- Overuse and pollution of water resources harming biodiversity
- Regional conflicts over scarce water resources sometimes resulting in warfare

- It has also been claimed, primarily by economists, that the water situation has occurred because of a lack of property rights, government regulations and subsidies in the water sector, causing prices to be too low and consumption too high.[^21][^22][^23]

- biodiversity => lost of wetlands => lost of protal water => water crisis
- physical scaricity:
    + frequently suffer =>arid regions
    + over-committed resources=> over development of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation
- economic water scarcity:
    + lack of investment in infrastructure or technology/insufficient human capacity

## Plans in history

### Millennium Development Goals
economic support

### China
- 南水北调
- 修建水库
- 控制人口数量，提高素质
- 减少水污染，减少浪费，提高利用率
- 限制高耗水工业发展
- 发展节水农业，采用滴灌，喷灌技术
- 实行水价调节
- 海水淡化

- 干旱一般发生在湿润地区
    + 人口稠密，经济发达(工业发达)

renewable water supply:
China 2738.0
